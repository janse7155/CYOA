    <p>You shake your head. Copies of you, wisps of light, strange deer. This is
        too much. You just wanted to go on a simple walk tp clear your
        head. You turn back, retracing your steps until you return to town.
        However, you can shake the feeling like you were on the cusps of greatness.
