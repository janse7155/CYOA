    <p>Well. You threw yourself over the edge of the waterfall with a majestic
        swan dive. Great form by the way. You would make a great competitive diver.
        That is, if you didn't land in the large amount of jagged rocks at the
        bottom of the waterfall. Shoulda looked before you leaped. Only one thing
        to do now.
