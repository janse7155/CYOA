    <h1>Forest Deer</h1> 
    <img src="index.png">
    <p>You follow the strange deer. It leads you much deeper into the forest.
        The sunlight barely breaks through the canopy above. The deer turns to
        look at you. Like it wants something. You think to what you had in your
        backpack. Water and your lunch. Now that you think about it, you are
        kinda hungry...
    </p>
