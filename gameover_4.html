    <p>Congrats! As you place the throny crown on your head,
        you feel a strange sensation. This is where you belong.
        This forest, this stump. This is your throne, and this is your
        kingdom. You shall reign forever. That is, until you stop feeling
        your body. You look down and watch as you body gets absorbed into
        the stump, you becoming one of the many faces on the stump you hadn't
        seen until now. Maybe you shouldn't have placed the strange crown on your head.
