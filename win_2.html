    <h1>An Ancient Memento</h1> 
    <img src="index.png">
    <p>You lift the crown up, tempted to place it on your head.
        You then notice the faces in the stump the crown was on. Maybe
        its best that you don't wear this crown. You place it in your
        backpack, and start on your way home. The crown now rests on your
        mantle, a new family hierloom. Though, you wonder if you really
        found everything.
